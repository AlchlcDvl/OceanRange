Despite their fiery tendencies, these slimes prefer a milder diet of vegetables, with the blowtato being their ultimate delight. This root's highly volatile compounds provide the perfect internal spark for their constant energetic needs and powerful bursts.

When a mesmer slime is left alone without the company of others, its mood will also fall. During agitation, mesmer slimes exhibit a feral-like state, seemingly unhappy due to the gut feeling that no one wants to be friends with them. They channel this disappointment by exhibiting eye and mouth patterns similar to the tarr, which only scares off other slimes even more.

The cause of these disturbances is currently unknown, but rest assured: our teams are on it.\n\nA certified Slimeologist will be reaching out to you shortly with further information and guidance.

Been studyin' their behaviors, quirks, and oddities since I first touched down on the Far, Far Range. If it jiggles, hops, or purrs, chances are I've logged a dozen pages on it.\n\nLately, reports have been floodin' in about some strange slime activity happenin' right near your patch of land. Can't say I've seen anything quite like it in the data — and trust me, that's sayin' something.\n\nSo! I'll be reachin' out through the Range Exchange in a couple o' days. Nothin' too formal — just a quick chat, maybe get your eyes on a few of these peculiar slime friends, if you're willin'. Could be nothin'... or it might just be the biggest slime mystery this dusty ol' rock's ever seen.\n\nKeep an eye on those corrals, yeah?\n\nCheers,\n- Lisa.\nFar, Far Range S.P.L.A.S.H.\n\nP.S. If a slime starts hummin' at ya... don't panic. Just write it down."
