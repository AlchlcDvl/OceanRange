Beauty companies frequently market their products as the key to a youthful glow, claiming that rosi pearls help rewind aging skin by 20-50 years. This wouldn't be a problem if their frills were also believed to have abilities to cure internal organs, even rare cancers when consumed. While their frills can slowly regenerate constant tearing causes smaller gills to grow. However, new research shows that these healing properties are temporary. The resulting constant consumption and usage of the pearl cause rapid aging, making rosi pearls an unreliable anti-aging solution."

Unlike their explosive kin, a mine slime's detonations are triggered only by direct contact with another slime or an unwary rancher. To deter accidental bumps, their bodies are adorned with sharp, crystalline spikes; a clear warning sign. Despite their fiery tendencies, these slimes prefer a milder diet of vegetables, with the blowtato being their ultimate delight. This root's highly volatile compounds provide the perfect internal spark for their constant energetic needs and powerful bursts. If a mine slime goes too long without popping, however, their internal pressure builds to uncomfortable levels, driving them to seek relief by finding water, or joining in an explosive embrace with fellow boom or mine slimes.",
        "risks": "Approach mine slimes with caution, for their spikes aren't just for show! Any direct contact will result in a localized eruption. While other slimes will be boomed clear of the danger zone, only fellow mine slimes and their boom cousins possess a natural immunity to these contact explosions. This peculiar trait makes co-habitation an active (and often loud) affair, as they'll seek out their explosive kin for regular, relieving bursts. Keeping them together helps manage their volatile nature, preventing an otherwise grumpy slime.",
        "plortonomics": "Mine plorts are curious, resilient gems, forged into a pearl-like shape under the immense internal pressures of the mine slime. These unique pearls retain a fragment of their progenitor's explosive nature, though a considerably firmer thwack is required to unleash their contained energy. Their peculiar, controlled detonations make them highly prized in industrial applications, particularly when refined into a fine powder. From powering small, controlled bursts in excavation to adding a spectacular sparkle to interstellar fireworks displays, mine pearls certainly make an impact on the galactic exchange."

        "slimeology": "The sand slime, a curious terrestrial cousin to both the puddle and fire slimes, makes its home along the shallow, sun-drenched shores of the Far, Far Range. Much like its elemental kin, these intriguing slimes require no typical sustenance from a rancher's feeder; instead, they subsist entirely on good old dirt. After sifting through the gritty soil, sand slimes process the minerals within, producing glimmering plorts that bear a striking resemblance to Earth's precious pearls. Their calm demeanor and unique diet make them a rather low-maintenance addition to any ranch.",
        "risks": "Rest easy, ranchers! The sand slime is one of the most delightfully docile slimes you'll encounter. These mellow blobs pose virtually no risk to the ranch, thriving peacefully in any populated corral without inciting a single outbreak. However, despite their beach-dwelling nature, sand slimes are surprisingly delicate when it comes to deep water; prolonged submersion will cause them to slowly dissolve! Even their valuable pearl plorts are safe from hungry mouths; it seems no other slime has a taste for a glistening pearl that began its life as common dirt. Their laid-back nature and inability to cause a ruckus make them perfect companions for even the most timid slimes, just keep them away from the deep end!",
        "plortonomics": "Sand plorts are true marvels of natural refinement. Though the sand slime itself is soft and yielding, the pearls it produces are remarkably tougher than their Earth counterparts, defying their humble origins. These pristine, spherical treasures, born from nothing more than processed soil, fetch an exceptional price on the Plort Market. Their iridescent sheen and superior durability make them highly sought-after for crafting exquisite jewelry and other luxury adornments across the galaxy, proving that true beauty can indeed come from the ground up!"

Interestingly, they seem to be very sociable. Mesmer slimes spend most of their time inside lush jungles and caverns on the island, where you could easily spot their glows.",
        "risks": "Mesmer slimes may be a risk to the ranch, as the patterns they produce enact a hypnotic effect on slimes that gaze upon them, which can leave them bundled up together for hours—especially during the dark, where their glow is most visible. When a mesmer slime is left alone without the company of others, its mood will also fall. During agitation, mesmer slimes exhibit a feral-like state, seemingly unhappy due to the gut feeling that no one wants to be friends with them. They channel this disappointment by exhibiting eye and mouth patterns similar to the tarr, which only scares off other slimes even more. They will also pounce and mindlessly attack ranchers and slimes with their bug-like appendages. Otherwise... they’re quite simple to take care of.",
