Foundation (Slime Preservation, Learning, Assistance, Sanctuary & Harmony), would like to inform you of unusual phenomena occurring across the region.\n\nReports indicate that non-native slimes—creatures not previously known to inhabit these ecosystems—are beginning to appear in unexpected locations. The cause of these disturbances is currently unknown, but rest assured: our teams are on it.\n\nA certified Slimeologist will be reaching out to you shortly with further information and guidance. In the meantime, proceed with caution and report any unusual slime behavior through your Starmail terminal.\n\nStay safe, stay curious.\n\nSincerely,\nThe Board of S.P.L.A.S.H.",
