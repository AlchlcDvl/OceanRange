        "slimeology": "The Rosa Slime is the most common slime found in The Great Reef. They are often seen as cheerful, friendly, and mischievous, often pranking other slimes and even humans. Rosa Slimes have a deep bond with one another and are very rarely seen alone, As long as they have a partner to play with, they will be happy forever, rarely showing any sadness. And when they are sad it's often at the expense of others. Trying their best to cheer the slime or human back to their happy selves.",
        "risks": "There is not much to worry about the Rosa Slime. They are very easy to Ranch, only needing food and companionship. A lonely Rosa Slime is a sad Rosa Slime. So it's recommended for ranchers to have more than one if they want a healthy production of Pearls.",
        "plortonomics": "Rosa Pearls are often called \"The Aphrodite Pearl\" for their rejuvenating properties on human skin. Beauty companies frequently market their products as the key to a youthful glow, claiming that Rosa Pearls help rewind aging skin by 20-50 years. This wouldn't be a problem if their Feather Gills were also believed to have abilities to cure internal organs, even rare cancers when consumed. While their Feather Gills can slowly regenerate constant tearing causes smaller gills to grow. However, new research shows that these healing properties are temporary. The resulting constant consumption and usage of the Pearl cause rapid aging, making Rosa Pearls an unreliable anti-aging solution."

        "slimeology": "Coco slimes are commonly found hanging from the palm trees of the island. Being natives to SwirlPool Island, the coco slimes have natural adapted a higher jump in order to climb trees and escape predators. Due to them being grown from palm trees, they have plant like attributes which causes them to require constant sunlight and also tend to avoid eating fruits and vegetables as it would be cannibalism.",
        "risks": "Be cautious while walking under palm trees as coco slimes are very territorial and if they sense you underneath, they will harden their soft, squishy bodies to a hard coconut-like shell and crash down onto their targets. Tourists in the past who got hit in the head by a coco slime have reported blurred vision and dizziness afterwards with some even being knocked out cold. This is also how they hunt in the wild. Despite their hard skin and agility, they are quite easy to ranch as long as they are well feed and have enough exposure to sunlight.",
        "plortonomics": "Coco Plorts, unlike their producer, are very soft and silky as well as being an excellent source of calcium when condensed to liquid. Despite being very similar to earthâ€™s milk in properties, they can still be consumed by people who are lactose intolerance making them extremely popular for creating lactose intolerance options for dairy products. And due to their incredibly soft and silky texture, they are also very good for skin care and used often in spas as substitutes to milk baths."
