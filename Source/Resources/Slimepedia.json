Rosi Slimes have a deep bond with one another and are very rarely seen alone, As long as they have a partner to play with, they will be happy forever, rarely showing any sadness.

        "plortonomics": "Rosi Pearls are often called \"The Aphrodite Pearl\" for their rejuvenating properties on human skin. Beauty companies frequently market their products as the key to a youthful glow, claiming that Rosi Pearls help rewind aging skin by 20-50 years. This wouldn't be a problem if their Feather Gills were also believed to have abilities to cure internal organs, even rare cancers when consumed. While their Feather Gills can slowly regenerate constant tearing causes smaller gills to grow. However, new research shows that these healing properties are temporary. The resulting constant consumption and usage of the Pearl cause rapid aging, making Rosi Pearls an unreliable anti-aging solution."

Tourists in the past who got hit in the head by a cocoa slime have reported blurred vision and dizziness afterwards with some even being knocked out cold. This is also how they hunt in the wild. Despite their hard skin and agility, they are quite easy to ranch as long as they are well feed and have enough exposure to sunlight.",

Despite being very similar to earthâ€™s milk in properties, they can still be consumed by people who are lactose intolerance making them extremely popular for creating lactose intolerance options for dairy products. And due to their incredibly soft and silky texture, they are also very good for skin care and used often in spas as substitutes to milk baths.",

As a way to tell others to stay away from them, mine slimes evolved spikes on their bodies to keep others away from contact and subsequent explosions. Unlike their boom cousins however, mine slimes prefer going the peaceful route of eating vegetables. To support their explosive qualities, their favourite is the blowtato, which contains enough reactive chemicals to fuel both bodily functions and explosive qualities of the mine slime. However, if the explosion keeps building up for too long, the mine slime risks damaging itself. During this phase the mine slime would seek water or other boom or mine slimes to explode with them and regain comfort.",

However, due to the nature of the source of the plorts, the contact needs to be much harder in order for the plorts to explode. Due to this peculiar property, mine plorts are often just ground to fine power to use for fireworks."

Slime nature is indeed peculiar. Much like its cousins, the lantern slimes can be found at night in the deepest parts of the Moss Blanket and the Great Reef. They are often seen alone and rarely in groups, as they prefer an isolated lifestyle and little interest in socializing. However, when it comes to humans, lantern slimes often aid divers in finding their way back to land.",

When disturbed from their nap, they emit a bright flash to startle any diver or slime that dares to interrupt their beauty sleep. However, at night, they become very docile and can be found swimming across the coral reef in search of food.",

These peals not only hydrate the skin but also impart a radiant, plum-like glow, making them ideal for night creams. However, it's important to note that their protective barrier against bacteria diminishes rapidly when exposed to sunlight. Therefore, products containing a high concentration of lantern pearls are best applied before bedtime for their benefits."
