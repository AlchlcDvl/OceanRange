Beauty companies frequently market their products as the key to a youthful glow, claiming that Rosi Pearls help rewind aging skin by 20-50 years. This wouldn't be a problem if their Feather Gills were also believed to have abilities to cure internal organs, even rare cancers when consumed. While their Feather Gills can slowly regenerate constant tearing causes smaller gills to grow. However, new research shows that these healing properties are temporary. The resulting constant consumption and usage of the Pearl cause rapid aging, making Rosi Pearls an unreliable anti-aging solution."

Tourists in the past who got hit in the head by a cocoa slime have reported blurred vision and dizziness afterwards with some even being knocked out cold. This is also how they hunt in the wild. Despite their hard skin and agility, they are quite easy to ranch as long as they are well feed and have enough exposure to sunlight.",

Despite being very similar to earthâ€™s milk in properties, they can still be consumed by people who are lactose intolerance making them extremely popular for creating lactose intolerance options for dairy products. And due to their incredibly soft and silky texture, they are also very good for skin care and used often in spas as substitutes to milk baths.",

Unlike their explosive kin, a Mine Slime's detonations are triggered only by direct contact with another slime or an unwary rancher. To deter accidental bumps, their bodies are adorned with sharp, crystalline spikes; a clear warning sign. Despite their fiery tendencies, these slimes prefer a milder diet of vegetables, with the Blowtato being their ultimate delight. This root's highly volatile compounds provide the perfect internal spark for their constant energetic needs and powerful bursts. If a Mine Slime goes too long without popping, however, their internal pressure builds to uncomfortable levels, driving them to seek relief by finding water, or joining in an explosive embrace with fellow Boom or Mine Slimes.",
        "risks": "Approach Mine Slimes with caution, for their spikes aren't just for show! Any direct contact will result in a localized eruption. While other slimes will be boomed clear of the danger zone, only fellow Mine Slimes and their Boom cousins possess a natural immunity to these contact explosions. This peculiar trait makes co-habitation an active (and often loud) affair, as they'll seek out their explosive kin for regular, relieving bursts. Keeping them together helps manage their volatile nature, preventing an otherwise grumpy slime.",
        "plortonomics": "Mine Plorts are curious, resilient gems, forged into a pearl-like shape under the immense internal pressures of the Mine Slime. These unique plorts retain a fragment of their progenitor's explosive nature, though a considerably firmer thwack is required to unleash their contained energy. Their peculiar, controlled detonations make them highly prized in industrial applications, particularly when refined into a fine powder. From powering small, controlled bursts in excavation to adding a spectacular sparkle to interstellar fireworks displays, Mine Plorts certainly make an impact on the galactic exchange."

Slime nature is indeed peculiar. Much like its cousins, the lantern slimes can be found at night in the deepest parts of the Moss Blanket and the Great Reef. They are often seen alone and rarely in groups, as they prefer an isolated lifestyle and little interest in socializing. However, when it comes to humans, lantern slimes often aid divers in finding their way back to land.",
        "risks": "Lantern slimes aren't the most social compared to other slime species. During the day, they can be found sleeping in dark caves. When disturbed from their nap, they emit a bright flash to startle any diver or slime that dares to interrupt their beauty sleep. However, at night, they become very docile and can be found swimming across the coral reef in search of food.",
        "plortonomics": "Lantern pearls are a key ingredient in many beauty products due to their natural moisturizing properties. These peals not only hydrate the skin but also impart a radiant, plum-like glow, making them ideal for night creams. However, it's important to note that their protective barrier against bacteria diminishes rapidly when exposed to sunlight. Therefore, products containing a high concentration of lantern pearls are best applied before bedtime for their benefits."

Much like its elemental kin, these intriguing slimes require no typical sustenance from a rancher's feeder; instead, they subsist entirely on good old dirt. After sifting through the gritty soil, Sand Slimes process the minerals within, producing glimmering plorts that bear a striking resemblance to Earth's precious pearls. Their calm demeanor and unique diet make them a rather low-maintenance addition to any ranch.",

These mellow blobs pose virtually no risk to the ranch, thriving peacefully in any populated corral without inciting a single outbreak. However, despite their beach-dwelling nature, Sand Slimes are surprisingly delicate when it comes to deep water; prolonged submersion will cause them to slowly dissolve! Even their valuable pearl plorts are safe from hungry mouths; it seems no other slime has a taste for a glistening pearl that began its life as common dirt. Their laid-back nature and inability to cause a ruckus make them perfect companions for even the most timid slimes, just keep them away from the deep end!",
        "plortonomics": "Sand Plorts are true marvels of natural refinement. Though the Sand Slime itself is soft and yielding, the pearls it produces are remarkably tougher than their Earth counterparts, defying their humble origins. These pristine, spherical treasures, born from nothing more than processed soil, fetch an exceptional price on the Plort Market. Their iridescent sheen and superior durability make them highly sought-after for crafting exquisite jewelry and other luxury adornments across the galaxy, proving that true beauty can indeed come from the ground up!"
