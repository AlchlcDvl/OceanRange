        "about": "The blowtato is a volatile variant of Earth's potato, found exclusively in the Indigo Quarry. It is very reactive in nature due to its chemical composition. It is recommended to make a slight cut to the blowtato before cooking to prevent it from exploding. Mine slimes love the blowtato as it contains enough chemicals to fuel them. Miners often use the blowtato to weaken rocks for mining."
