# The Ocean Range
Ocean Range is a Slime Rancher mod in active development that dives into a whole new region of the Far, Far Range—an expansive, oceanic world brought to life through community creativity and collaboration. Featuring brand-new slimes, foods, and gordo encounters, Ocean Range also introduces a story-driven experience that expands the Slime Rancher universe in a fresh, narrative-focused direction. Funded and inspired by the community, this project is envisioned as a continuation of the various ranch expansions like Mochi's, Ogden's and Victor's, celebrating the imaginative spirit that defines Slime Rancher at its core.

Make sure to read the known issues before reporting bugs! Duplicates will be removed.
