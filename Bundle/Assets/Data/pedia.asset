        Value: There is not much to worry about the rosi slime. They are very easy
          to ranch, only needing food and companionship. A lonely rosi slime is a
          sad rosi slime. So it's recommended for ranchers to have more than one

        Value: The rosi slime is the most common slime found in The Great Reef. They
          are often seen as cheerful, friendly and mischievous, often pranking other
          slimes and even humans. Rosi slimes have a deep bond with one another and
          are very rarely seen alone, As long as they have a partner to play with,
          they will be happy forever, rarely showing any sadness. And when they are
          sad it's often at the expense of others. Trying their best to cheer the
          slime or human back to their happy selves.

        Value: Rosi pearls are often called the "Aphrodite Pearl" for their rejuvenating
          properties on human skin. Beauty companies frequently market their products
          as the key to a youthful glow, claiming that rosi pearls help rewind aging
          skin by 20-50 years. This wouldn't be a problem if their frills were also
          believed to have abilities to cure internal organs, even rare cancers when
          consumed. While their frills can slowly regenerate constant tearing causes
          smaller gills to grow. However, new research shows that these healing properties
          are temporary. The resulting constant consumption and usage of the pearl
          cause rapid aging, making rosi pearls an unreliable anti-aging solution.

        Value: Be cautious while walking under palm trees as coco slimes are very
          territorial and if they sense you underneath, they will harden their soft,
          squishy bodies to a hard coconut-like shell and crash down onto their targets.
          Tourists in the past who got hit in the head by a coco slime have reported
          blurred vision and dizziness afterwards with some even being knocked out
          cold. This is also how they hunt in the wild. Despite their hard skin and
          agility, they are quite easy to ranch as long as they are well feed and
          have enough exposure to sunlight.

        Value: Coco slimes are commonly found hanging from the palm trees of the
          island. Being natives to SwirlPool Island, the coco slimes have natural
          adapted a higher jump in order to climb trees and escape predators. Due
          to them being grown from palm trees, they have plant like attributes which
          causes them to require constant sunlight and also tend to avoid eating
          fruits and vegetables as it would be cannibalism.

          being very similar to earth's milk in properties, they can still be consumed
          by people who are lactose intolerant, making them extremely popular for
          creating lactose intolerance options for dairy products. And due to their
          incredibly soft and silky texture, they are also very good for skin care
          and used often in spas as substitutes to milk baths.

      Risks:

        Value: Approach mine slimes with caution, for their spikes aren't just for
          show! Any direct contact will result in a localized eruption. While other
          slimes will be boomed clear of the danger zone, only fellow mine slimes
          and their boom cousins possess a natural immunity to these contact explosions.
          This peculiar trait makes co-habitation an active (and often loud) affair,
          as they'll seek out their explosive kin for regular, relieving bursts.
          Keeping them together helps manage their volatile nature, preventing an
          otherwise grumpy slime.
      Slimeologies:
      - Key: EN
        Value: The mine slime, a distant and more... prickly cousin to the boom slime,
          has a unique take on volatility. Unlike their explosive kin, a mine slime's
          detonations are triggered only by direct contact with another slime or
          an unwary rancher. To deter accidental bumps, their bodies are adorned
          with sharp, crystalline spikes; a clear warning sign. Despite their fiery
          tendencies, these slimes prefer a milder diet of vegetables, with the blowtato
          being their ultimate delight. This root's highly volatile compounds provide
          the perfect internal spark for their constant energetic needs and powerful
          bursts. If a mine slime goes too long without popping, however, their internal
          pressure builds to uncomfortable levels, driving them to seek relief by
          finding water, or joining in an explosive embrace with fellow boom or mine
          slimes.

          pearls retain a fragment of their progenitor's explosive nature, though
          a considerably firmer thwack is required to unleash their contained energy.
          Their peculiar, controlled detonations make them highly prized in industrial
          applications, particularly when refined into a fine powder. From powering
          small, controlled bursts in excavation to adding a spectacular sparkle
          to interstellar fireworks displays, mine pearls certainly make an impact

        Value: Lantern slimes aren't the most social compared to other slime species.
          During the day, they can be found sleeping. When disturbed from their nap,
          they emit a bright flash to startle any diver or slime that dares to interrupt
          their beauty sleep and try to run away. However, at night, they become
          very docile and can be found swimming across the coral reef in search of
          food.
      Slimeologies:

        Value: The lantern slime is a distant cousin of the phosphor slime. At one
          point in its evolution, the phosphor slimes expelled their inner core,
          using it to attract prey underwater. Slime nature is indeed peculiar. Much
          like its cousins, the lantern slimes can be found at night in the deepest
          parts of the Moss Blanket and the Great Reef. They are often seen alone
          and rarely in groups, as they prefer an isolated lifestyle and little interest
          in socializing. However, when it comes to humans, lantern slimes often
          aid divers in finding their way back to land.

          skin but also impart a radiant, plum-like glow, making them ideal for night
          creams. However, it's important to note that their protective barrier against
          bacteria diminishes rapidly when exposed to sunlight. Therefore, products

          bedtime for their benefits.

          docile slimes you'll encounter. These mellow blobs pose virtually no risk
          to the ranch, thriving peacefully in any populated corral without inciting
          a single outbreak. However, despite their beach-dwelling nature, sand slimes
          are surprisingly delicate when it comes to deep water; prolonged submersion
          will cause them to slowly dissolve! Even their valuable pearl plorts are
          safe from hungry mouths; it seems no other slime has a taste for a glistening
          pearl that began its life as common dirt. Their laid-back nature and inability

          no typical sustenance from a rancher's feeder; instead, they subsist entirely
          on good old dirt. After sifting through the gritty soil, sand slimes process
          the minerals within, producing glimmering plorts that bear a striking resemblance
          to Earth's precious pearls. Their calm demeanor and unique diet make them
          a rather low-maintenance addition to any ranch.

          coconuts, stones, and even garbage like boxes. Its favorite food is coral
          fruit, a delicious fruit that grows from an exotic plant that grows in
          the crevices of rocks and near the sea, this food can help the rancher

          Unlike most chickens that try to blend in with their surroundings, the
          radiant hen has evolved feathers that glow with a soft, ethereal light.
          This makes them incredibly easy to spot, a trait that would typically be

          is irresistible. They are often found clustered around these hens, seemingly
          mesmerized by their unique radiance. It's believed the hens' constant,
          gentle light helps to regulate the lantern slimes' internal bioluminescence,

      About:
      - Key: EN
        Value: The blowtato is a peculiar, highly reactive root vegetable, mostly
          found sprouting from the cracked earth of the Indigo Quarry. Much like
          the mine slimes that adore them, these spuds have a natural propensity
          for explosive flair due to a volatile compound within. Ranchers must handle
          them with extreme care, as a small puncture or "burp" is recommended before
          cooking to prevent a startling bang! For mine slimes, this explosive nature
          is pure delight, fueling their rock-shattering abilities and making the
          blowtato their favorite snack. Clever miners even use them to loosen stubborn
          rock formations, though caution is always advised.

          with the S.P.L.A.S.H. Foundation (Slime Preservation, Learning, Assistance,
          Sanctuary & Harmony), would like to inform you of unusual phenomena occurring
          across the region.


          Reports indicate that non-native slimes,
          creatures not previously known to inhabit these ecosystems, are beginning
          to appear in unexpected locations. The cause of these disturbances is currently
          unknown, but rest assured: our teams are on it.


          A certified
          Slimeologist will be reaching out to you shortly with further information
          and guidance. In the meantime, proceed with caution and report any unusual
          slime behavior through your Starmail terminal.


          Stay safe, stay
          curious.


          Sincerely,

          The Board of S.P.L.A.S.H.'

          Been studyin' their behaviors, quirks, and oddities since I first touched
          down on the Far, Far Range. If it jiggles, hops, or purrs, chances are
          I've logged a dozen pages on it.\n\nLately, reports have been floodin'
          in about some strange slime activity happenin' right near your patch of
          land. Can't say I've seen anything quite like it in the data \u2014 and
          trust me, that's sayin' something.\n\nSo! I'll be reachin' out through
          the Range Exchange in a couple o' days. Nothin' too formal \u2014 just
          a quick chat, maybe get your eyes on a few of these peculiar slime friends,
          if you're willin'. Could be nothin'... or it might just be the biggest
