They are often found clustered around these hens, seemingly mesmerized by their unique radiance. It's believed the hens' constant, gentle light helps to regulate the lantern slimes' internal bioluminescence, which can sometimes become unstable. For ranchers, the radiant hen is a beacon, making them surprisingly easy to locate in the dark corners of the Far, Far Range. Their meat, however, tastes just like a regular chicken."

Ranchers must handle them with extreme care, as a small puncture or \"burp\" is recommended before cooking to prevent a startling bang!

You could say I'm a bit of a slime whisperer. Been studyin' their behaviors, quirks, and oddities since I first touched down on the Far, Far Range. If it jiggles, hops, or purrs, chances are I've logged a dozen pages on it.\n\nLately, reports have been floodin' in about some strange slime activity happenin' right near your patch of land. Can't say I've seen anything quite like it in the data — and trust me, that's sayin' something.\n\nSo! I'll be reachin' out through the Range Exchange in a couple o' days. Nothin' too formal — just a quick chat, maybe get your eyes on a few of these peculiar slime friends, if you're willin'. Could be nothin'... or it might just be the biggest slime mystery this dusty ol' rock's ever seen.\n\nKeep an eye on those corrals, yeah?\n\nCheers,\n- Lisa.\nFar, Far Range S.P.L.A.S.H.\n\nP.S. If a slime starts hummin' at ya... don't panic. Just write it down."
